# Development Journal

I started this project a couple months before creating this document. I have a
bad memory, and I decided I should probably document some of the procedures for
required for this project as well as some of my thought processes.

## Initial Idea

The motivation behind this app was to provide a less brain hijacking alternative
to Instagram. I came up with the simple idea to replace images with simple
color squares.

The first version of this app was super simple. Draw a feed of
randomly generated color squares.

### Getting Started

First step is to setup the environment (Correct this section in later)

Install nodejs and npm using your package manager.

Install expo-cli globally: `$ sudo npm i -g expo-cli`
